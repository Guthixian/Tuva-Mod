Forgotten by his country, it was his refusal to accept defeat that drove him to escape. Returning to a Russia broken and divided, it was his ambition to one day avenge his comrades that led to the foundation of the §YBlack League§!, a state centered around his tenents of §GNational Survival§! and the §RGreat Trial.§!\n\nIn a cruel twist of fate, however, hatred has become Karbyshev's greatest enemy.\n\nOld and feeble, the Black League's leader finds himself outmaneuvered at every turn, his greatest work now dominated by a thirst for vengeance even he had once thought unimaginable. One that does not seek to defeat Germany, but destroy it. One that does not intend to preserve Russia, but to sacrifice it.\n\nNow, with the Reich growing weaker, and the radical, ultramilitarist officer §YDmitry Yazov§! his successor in all but name, only one thing is clear to the dying general: The §rTeutonic Menace§! will pay for every piece, nay, every inch of Russia they have looted and stolen;\n\n§xOne way or another.§!§!§!"

Even in the streets of the West Russian Revolutionary Front, with its starving citizens and skeletons in uniform, how could anyone believe that the revolution was nothing more than a fleeting ecstasy, an unachievable dream?\n\nSome, however, are not so easily convinced.\n\nIn the frozen lands of Plesetsk and Ukhta, §xMikhail Tukhachevsky§! and §PGeorgy Zhukov§! refuse to accept defeat. Their martial prowess outmatched only by their devotion to the Union, one of the two generals is certain to soon replace the frail §YAleksandr Yegorov§! as Marshal of the Revolutionary Front. Although their ambitions may radically differ, no matter who gets their way, the shockwaves of their ascension will be felt across the world. The borders will be expanded, the factories will be relit, and in time, the Front's eyes will turn west once more.\n\nAnd this time, they shall not know failure.

 PRC_THENEWORDER_DESC: ""You only have to kick in the door and the whole rotten structure will come crashing down."\n\nThese are the words Adolf Hitler spoke as he destroyed the glorious Soviet Union. But what was that rot that led to the downfall of the Motherland? Is it men like Nikolai Shchelokov and Leonid Brezhnev, careerist kleptocratic apparatchiks who line their pockets with Rubles while the Soviet people suffer? \n\nThey do not seem to think so. In their eyes, they are true communist patriots who will end the Russian anarchy, restore order to the Union and who will destroy its enemies. \n\nAnd they will live like kings."
