 ### Leader Desc ###
 PRC_Aleksandr_Vasilevsky: "Aleksandr Vasilevsky" 
 POLITICS_ALEKSANDER_VASILEVSKY_DESC: "Aleksandr Mikhailovich Vasilevsky was the son of a Russian Orthodox priest and was expected to follow in his father's footsteps, but he was drawn to a military life and traded his seminarian's robes for a soldier's uniform. He fought in the Imperial Russian Army and rose through the ranks, but resigned his post during the October Revolution and spent much of the Russian Civil War commanding soldiers well behind the front lines. In the interwar years, he distinguished himself as a skilled organizer, and befriended other notable officers such as Alexander Yegorov, Mikhail Tukhachevsky, and Georgy Zhukov. When the Germans invaded, Vasilevsky was serving in Bukharin's general staff, and his ability to work well under pressure helped him rise through the ranks. But not even his skills could stop the evacuation of Moscow from degenerating into a mad stampede as soldiers, bureaucrats, and millions of civilians desperately fighting each other for a coveted safe passage out of the city.\n\nDetermined to help as much of the Red Army to survive as possible, Vasilevsky organized a semi-orderly retreat of the forces that escaped the Mozhaisk defense line and marched east, over the Urals. Their goal: the Mongolian People's Republic, where they could regroup and resume the offensive. But the opportunity never came, for the Japanese and their puppet state of Mengjiang had already invaded Ulaanbaatar and forced the remnants of the Mongolian Army into the steppes. Vasilevsky formed a tenuous alliance with the Mongolians, and the two armies set up a domain in the former Tuvan People's Republic. They were isolated from the West Russian War, the Siberian War and the fall of the People's Republic of Western Siberia. They gladly avoided Yagoda's government in Irkutsk, fearful that he would label their retreat as cowardice and have them shot for treason. But despite having no allies, Vasilevsky is still determined to rally his men, draft the battle plans, and fight their way back home."

 ###Events###
 
 PRC.1.t: "Tuva Intro"
 PRC.1.d: "Vasilevsky tried to hold the Siberian SR together after Bukharin died or whatever happened to him pregame, alongside Nikolai Shchelokov's Soviet police who was fighting a shadow war against the NKVD. Neither side won, the Union collapsed and now there's schizo rurikids and anarkiddies in the provinces oh no..."
 PRC.1.a: "Russkiy, Mir..."
 
 PRC.2.t: "Three Men Meet in Kyzyl"
 
 PRC.29.t: "Extent of Pension Reform"
 PRC.29.d: "Placeholder loc \n\nEither do a small increase in investment, a medium one, a big one, or pocket the money"
 PRC.29.a: "Spend a bit more on this."
 PRC.29.b: "Increasing pensions further is a good idea."
 PRC.29.c: "We will create a new pensioner class!"
 PRC.29.e: "On second thought, let's pocket the investment instead."
 
 PRC.40.t: "Alienable Rights"
 PRC.40.d: "This is all placeholder text but look at my Brezhnev constitution IRL :goog: \n\nArticle 39 enabled the government to prohibit any activities it considered detrimental by stating that "Enjoyment of the rights and freedoms of citizens must not be to the detriment of the interests of society or the state." \n\nArticle 59 obliged citizens to obey the laws and comply with the standards of socialist society as determined by the Party. The government did not treat as inalienable those political and socioeconomic rights the Constitution granted to the people. Citizens enjoyed rights only when the exercise of those rights did not interfere with the interests of the state, and the CPSU alone had the power and authority to determine policies for the government and society."
 PRC.40.a: "Not to worry comrades, temporary measures!"
 
 PRC_regional.4.t: "The Union on Unions"
 PRC_regional.4.d: "TIL The Soviet Union was very anti trade union IRL, also this event is about considering forcing the trade unions under state control after the Kostin debacle"
 PRC_regional.4.a: "The unions should fall in line."
 PRC_regional.4.b: "Perhaps we can invest a little in them instead."
 
 PRC_superregional.1975.t: "Pick Your Brezhnev"
 PRC_superregional.1975.d: "Until the BoP and GUI are finished you just get to pick a subideology like this sorry!"
